# counter-party-NFT

This code creates a new NFT asset called "MyNFT" with a description and some metadata. It then issues the new asset on the Bitcoin blockchain and prints the transaction hash.

Keep in mind that developing NFTs on the Bitcoin blockchain can be more complex and challenging compared to other blockchain platforms, so it's important to have a deep understanding of the technology and ecosystem before getting started.
